# Image to Pixel Representation in Excel  

## Description  
This program converts an image into pixel values and visualizes them in an Excel file. It maps pixel colors to Excel cells, showing how computers process and store images.  

## Requirements  
- Python 3.x  
- Libraries:  
  ```bash  
  pip install openpyxl pillow  
  ```  

## Usage  
1. Place the image file in the same folder as the script.  
2. Run the script.  
3. An Excel file (`image_pixels.xlsx`) will be generated with colored cells matching the image.  

## Libraries Used  
- **Pillow (PIL)**: For image processing.  
- **openpyxl**: For Excel file creation and styling.  

## Educational Value  
This project visually explains how computers interpret and represent image data in a pixel format.
